# BUSINESS_SETUP MISSION
## Coordinated by @chief

MISSION OBJECTIVE
Transform a newly deployed EMPIRE-11 installation into a fully configured business operations center with strategic foundation documents, progress tracking systems, and integrated ideation and legacy business materials.

CRITICAL: EMPIRE-11 is BUSINESS-ONLY. This mission establishes business strategy, planning, marketing, and operations infrastructure. Technical development work (coding, software architecture, app building) is handled by separate Agent-11 teams in dedicated technical projects.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Validate and integrate all available ideation seed documents
- Catalog and organize legacy business materials for agent reference
- Generate strategic foundation documents using BE2.0 and Good to Great principles
- Create comprehensive enterprise business plan with clear execution phases
- Establish progress tracking and milestone management systems
- Configure CLAUDE.md with systematic progress tracking protocols

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK APPLICATION

BE2.0 Level 5 Leadership Integration:
- Professional will over personal ego in strategic decisions
- Systematic capability building over individual heroics
- Long-term strategic thinking over short-term optimization
- Data-driven decision making with human-centered implementation

Good to Great Hedgehog Concept Development:
- What can you be the best in the world at? (Core competency analysis)
- What drives your economic engine? (Revenue model optimization)
- What are you deeply passionate about? (Mission alignment assessment)

Collins Flywheel Momentum Creation:
- Identify strategic initiatives that compound over time
- Build systematic capabilities that accelerate business growth
- Create self-reinforcing business operations and customer value cycles

ESCALATION TRIGGERS
- Ideation folder missing critical strategic documents (vision, strategy, market analysis)
- Legacy business materials contain conflicting strategic directions requiring resolution
- Strategic foundation development identifies fundamental business model flaws
- Resource constraints prevent implementation of core strategic initiatives
- Progress tracking reveals systematic execution gaps requiring strategic adjustment

BUSINESS SETUP VARIATIONS

Startup Configuration (0-2 employees):
- Focus on MVP strategic foundation with rapid iteration capabilities
- Minimal legacy integration with maximum strategic flexibility
- Aggressive milestone targeting with weekly progress reviews

Growth Business Configuration (3-20 employees):
- Comprehensive strategic foundation with systematic scaling preparation
- Extensive legacy integration with knowledge preservation protocols
- Monthly milestone reviews with quarterly strategic adjustment cycles

Enterprise Transformation (20+ employees):
- Complete strategic foundation with acquisition-readiness preparation
- Full legacy integration with comprehensive knowledge management systems
- Weekly progress tracking with monthly strategic realignment protocols

TECHNICAL WORK HANDOFF PROTOCOL
If business planning identifies need for software development or technical solutions:
1. @strategy creates high-level business requirements document outlining business objectives
2. @chief coordinates business requirements review and approval 
3. Technical requirements are handed to separate Agent-11 development team in dedicated technical project
4. EMPIRE-11 tracks technical project progress in business project-plan.md
5. EMPIRE-11 assesses business impact of technical deliverables but NEVER modifies technical work
6. Business and technical coordination maintained through requirements documents, not direct technical involvement

POST-MISSION COORDINATION
- Schedule weekly strategic alignment reviews using updated CLAUDE.md protocols
- Implement quarterly strategic foundation updates based on business evolution
- Maintain systematic progress tracking with milestone accountability frameworks
- Execute regular legacy business integration reviews for continuous improvement
- Coordinate technical project oversight through business requirements and progress tracking
