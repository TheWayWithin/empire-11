# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository containing only a basic README.md file. The project appears to be in its initial state with no source code, build configuration, or dependencies yet established.

## Current State

- No package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- No build or test scripts configured
- No source code structure present
- Single README.md file with minimal content

## Development Notes

Since this is a new/empty repository, any development work will need to establish:
- Project structure and architecture
- Build and dependency management system
- Testing framework and commands
- Development workflow and scripts

Future updates to this CLAUDE.md should include specific commands and architectural details once the project structure is established.
