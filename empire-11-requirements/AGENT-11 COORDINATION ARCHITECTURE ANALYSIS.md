# AGENT-11 COORDINATION ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

## Key Changes in Agent-11 Framework

### 1. NEW /coord Command System

**Implementation**: 
- `/coord` command activates THE COORDINATOR agent
- Can be used interactively (`/coord`) or with direct mission execution (`/coord build requirements.md`)
- Replaces manual multi-agent coordination with systematic mission orchestration

**Architecture**:
- THE COORDINATOR is a specialized agent that NEVER does specialist work
- Pure delegation model - routes ALL work to appropriate specialists
- Maintains project-plan.md and progress.md for tracking
- Follows strict mission protocols with wait-for-response patterns

### 2. Mission Library System

**Structure**:
- `/missions/` directory contains standardized mission protocols
- Each mission has clear phases, specialist assignments, and deliverables
- Mission library includes: BUILD, FIX, MVP, REFACTOR, DEPLOY, DOCUMENT, etc.
- Missions follow consistent format: briefing, phases, success criteria, variations

**Mission Format**:
- Mission Code and metadata (duration, complexity, squad required)
- Required inputs and optional inputs
- Detailed phases with lead agent and support agents
- Specific deliverables and success criteria
- Common variations (quick, enterprise, prototype)

### 3. Enhanced Agent Architecture

**Agent Structure**:
- Agents now include coordination protocols and escalation patterns
- Clear scope boundaries with ✅/❌ examples
- Specialist agents focus on their domain expertise
- THE COORDINATOR handles all cross-agent coordination

**Key Principles**:
- Stateless agents with document-based persistence
- No direct agent-to-agent communication (all through coordinator)
- Project-local deployment (each project gets its own agent team)
- Mission-centric workflow execution

### 4. Documentation-Based Project Management

**Project Tracking**:
- project-plan.md as single source of truth
- progress.md for learnings and issue tracking
- Tasks marked [ ] (incomplete) and [x] (complete)
- Real-time status updates with "Waiting for @[agent]" patterns

**Quality Assurance**:
- Explicit completion confirmation required from specialists
- No assumptions about task completion
- Systematic verification and validation protocols
- Mission debrief and lessons learned capture

## Implications for EMPIRE-11

### 1. Coordination Model Alignment

**EMPIRE-11 Should Adopt**:
- `/coord` command for business mission orchestration
- @chief agent as pure coordinator (never does specialist work)
- Mission library for standard business operations
- Document-based project management with business tracking

### 2. Mission-Centric Business Operations

**Business Mission Examples**:
- `/coord daily_standup` - Orchestrate daily business coordination
- `/coord campaign_launch marketing-brief.md` - Execute marketing campaigns
- `/coord quarterly_review` - Comprehensive business assessment
- `/coord growth_planning` - Strategic growth initiatives

### 3. Agent Specialization

**Clear Separation**:
- @chief coordinates but never executes business tasks
- @marketing handles all marketing work (never does sales or finance)
- @sales handles all revenue work (never does marketing or operations)
- Each agent has clear ✅/❌ scope boundaries

### 4. Business Document Management

**Tracking System**:
- business-plan.md as master business tracking document
- business-progress.md for business learnings and insights
- Area-specific tracking documents for each functional area
- Real-time status updates for business initiatives

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### 1. Agent Format Compliance

**Required Elements**:
- Agent metadata table (name, description, model, color)
- Core responsibilities (ONLY THESE) section
- Available specialists list for coordination
- Mission protocol with wait-for-response patterns
- Critical rules and escalation protocols

### 2. Mission Format Compliance

**Required Structure**:
- Mission briefing with code, duration, complexity
- Required inputs and optional inputs
- Detailed phases with lead and support agents
- Specific deliverables and success criteria
- Common variations and coordination notes

### 3. Coordination Protocol

**Implementation**:
- @chief ALWAYS starts with strategic analysis
- Creates business tracking documents with [ ] tasks
- Delegates to specialists with context and waits for response
- Updates tracking ONLY after specialist confirms completion
- Maintains "Waiting for @[agent]" status during delegation

### 4. Business Infrastructure Integration

**Document Management**:
- Each agent owns specific business documents
- Accountability-based document organization
- File naming convention: [Area]-[Type]-[Topic]
- Cross-agent coordination through @chief only

## Key Architectural Insights

### 1. Pure Coordination Model
- Coordinator never executes, only orchestrates
- All work delegated to appropriate specialists
- Clear wait-for-response patterns prevent assumptions
- Document-based tracking ensures accountability

### 2. Mission-Centric Operations
- Standardized workflows for common scenarios
- Reusable mission templates with proven patterns
- Clear success criteria and deliverable specifications
- Systematic approach to complex multi-agent tasks

### 3. Project-Local Intelligence
- Each project/business gets its own specialized team
- Agents understand specific project/business context
- No global pollution or context confusion
- Clean isolation between different projects/businesses

### 4. Documentation-First Approach
- All coordination through documented plans and progress
- Single source of truth for project/business status
- Systematic capture of learnings and improvements
- Quality assurance through explicit confirmation protocols

This architecture provides the perfect foundation for EMPIRE-11's business operations framework.
