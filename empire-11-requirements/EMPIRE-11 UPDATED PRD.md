# EMPIRE-11 UPDATED PRD
## Business Operations Suite Following Agent-11 Architecture

**Project**: EMPIRE-11 Business Operations Suite  
**Version**: 2.0 (Updated for Agent-11 Coordination Architecture)  
**Target**: Solopreneur Business Management  
**Delivery**: 8-10 hours total implementation  

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

EMPIRE-11 is a comprehensive business operations suite that provides solopreneurs with an AI-powered C-suite team. Following the proven Agent-11 architecture, EMPIRE-11 deploys 12 specialized business agents that collaborate through mission-centric workflows to manage all aspects of business operations.

### Key Innovation: Business Mission Orchestration

Just as Agent-11 uses `/coord build requirements.md` for development, EMPIRE-11 uses `/coord` for business operations:

```shell
# Business mission examples
/coord daily_standup                    # 15-minute daily coordination
/coord campaign_launch marketing-brief.md  # Marketing campaign execution
/coord quarterly_review                 # Comprehensive business assessment
/coord growth_planning                  # Strategic growth initiatives
```
