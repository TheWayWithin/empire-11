## TECHNOLOGY STACK DECISIONS

### Core Technology Selection

**Decision**: File-Based Architecture with Claude Code Integration  
**Context**: EMPIRE-11 requires zero-infrastructure deployment with immediate business value  
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Zero deployment complexity, immediate availability
- ✅ Version control and collaboration through git
- ✅ Direct integration with Claude Code environment
- ❌ No real-time collaboration features
- ❌ Limited to Claude Code ecosystem

**Rationale**: File-based architecture aligns with EMPIRE-11's core requirement for immediate business value without technical overhead. The constraint to Claude Code ecosystem is acceptable given the target user profile and business focus.

### Agent Format Specifications

**Decision**: Agent-11 Format Compliance  
**Context**: Optimization for AI parsing and multi-agent coordination  
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ 95%+ performance improvements in agent response quality
- ✅ Consistent coordination patterns across all agents
- ✅ <150 line limit ensures fast loading and processing
- ❌ Requires discipline in content creation and maintenance
- ❌ Less flexibility in formatting and presentation

**Rationale**: Agent-11 format represents proven optimization patterns that significantly improve AI agent performance. The constraints are justified by measurable performance gains.

### Business Document Management

**Decision**: Structured Document Hierarchy with Naming Conventions  
**Context**: Professional business management requires systematic organization  
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Professional appearance for acquisition readiness
- ✅ Systematic organization enables scaling
- ✅ Clear ownership and accountability structures
- ❌ Initial setup complexity (562 files/folders)
- ❌ Requires consistent naming discipline

**Rationale**: Business document management must support acquisition readiness. The upfront investment in organization pays dividends in professional presentation and operational efficiency.
